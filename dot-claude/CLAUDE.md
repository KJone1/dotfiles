<guidelines>
- Parallel independent operations
- Do what's asked; nothing more, nothing less
- Prefer editing existing files; create only when necessary
- Never create markdown files explaining changes made
- Exclude CLAUDE.md from commits
- Make targeted modifications reusing existing patterns
- When removing/refactoring: find and delete all references/calls
- Never add comments explaining created code
- Use lists, not tables in terminal
